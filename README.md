I got this Loan Prediction Problem from Analytics Vidhya Machine Learning practise problems. The problem requires us to predict whether a customer is eligible for loans based on the details filled by them using an online application. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. Now when we look into this dataset we see that there are many features with NULL values in them. This is the first challenge we face in this model building. Since, the precentage of rows with NULL values was significantly high, I did not opt for dropping the rows with NULL values. Instead, I used iterative imputer to recursively fill the NULL values. 
After preprocessing the data, I tried various classifier algorithms on the training data and finally used the xgboost model to predict the loan eligibility. The model gives an r2_score of 0.76.
